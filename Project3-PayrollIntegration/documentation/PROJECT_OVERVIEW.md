# Project Plan: Payroll Integration with GhIPSS & FlexCube

## 1. Project Overview
This project aims to develop a robust integration solution to automate the processing of bulk payroll files. The solution will ingest payroll data, transform it into the Ghana Interbank Payment and Settlement Systems (GhIPSS) Automated Clearing House (ACH) format, and post corresponding accounting entries to an Oracle FlexCube Core Banking System (CBS).

## 2. Key Objectives
- **Automation**: Eliminate manual intervention in payroll processing.
- **Accuracy**: Ensure 100% data integrity and transformation accuracy.
- **Efficiency**: Reduce the end-to-end processing time from hours to minutes.
- **Compliance**: Adhere strictly to GhIPSS file format specifications and financial data security standards.
- **Reconciliation**: Provide a complete, automated audit trail and reconciliation reporting.

## 3. Scope
- **In-Scope**:
    - Ingestion of payroll files (CSV, XML) from a secure SFTP location.
    - Parsing, validation, and enrichment of payroll records.
    - Transformation of data into GhIPSS ACH format.
    - Generation of accounting entries for Oracle FlexCube.
    - Comprehensive error handling and rejection reporting.
    - Staging of transactions for audit and reconciliation.
- **Out-of-Scope**:
    - The payroll generation application itself.
    - User interface for payroll management.
    - Direct communication with GhIPSS (files will be placed in a designated folder for a separate managed file transfer solution).

## 4. High-Level Timeline
- **Week 1**: Finalize requirements & technical design.
- **Week 2-3**: Develop ESQL modules and message flows.
- **Week 4**: Unit testing and integration testing.
- **Week 5**: User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and deployment preparation.
